# Setting up the System

Insert the Li-ion battery to the battery holder
connect the STM32f0discovery board to your laptop using the Mini USB type A cable
connect the light sensor HAT to your Laptop using Micro usb type B male connector and you should see two LED's light up
run the HAT code on your pc using STM32CubeIDE 
if you cover up the Light sensor HAT, the Blue LED on the STM32f0discovery board should blink
